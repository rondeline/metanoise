    "preview_summary": "Help us learn about how preschool children think about performance! In this study, your child will play two short games and then decide which game was easier.",
    "short_description": "In this study, your child will play two short games- one about counting objects from 1-10, and the other about guessing which of four objects is not like the rest. Then, they will decide which game was easier to play. \r\n\r\nPlease note: Continuous background speech will play for some portion of the study (approximately 3-5 minutes) and may be bothersome for children who are sensitive to sound.",
    "purpose": "How much do children understand how well they are doing on a task, especially in noisy environments? This study focuses on distraction from background noise. Sometimes, the sounds a child hears are an important part of their learning, and sometimes they are a distraction from focusing on their current task. Across many children, we will see if they are more likely to think a task was hard when it had irrelevant background noise. This will help us understand children\u2019s ideas about their own learning and cognitive performance.",
